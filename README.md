UniVail is a modern, intent-driven cross-chain bridging application built on the Avail Nexus SDK. It provides a seamless user interface for bridging assets across multiple blockchains, exploring intents, and managing multichain portfolios. Designed for speed, security, and simplicity, UniVail leverages intent-based execution to handle complex cross-chain operations with minimal friction.

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Yarn or npm

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory (inside the frontend folder):
   ```
   VITE_APPKIT_PROJECT_ID=your_appkit_project_id
   VITE_WAGMI_PROJECT_ID=your_wagmi_project_id
   # Add any additional chain-specific RPC URLs if needed
   ```

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Output will be in the `dist/` folder. Serve it with any static file server.
